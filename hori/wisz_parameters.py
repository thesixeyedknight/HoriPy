# Born radii (R_Born) for different groups are mentioned as a single value in Table II

# Partial charges for non-titrating groups (PARSE/CHARMM22)
# The paper mentions using PARSE for neutral amino acids and CHARMM22 for non-AA groups.
# For HoriPy, these are already handled by the force field selected for the PQR generation (AMBER in current HoriPy).
# The Wisz model itself would need these partial charges for the QP (charge-polar) term.
#HoriPy's `Atom` object (derived from PDB2PQR output) already has reliable partial charges, we can use those.

# Charges of ionizable groups in their neutral and charged states:
# The paper states: "partial charges for the neutral form of these side chains are derived by distributing a unit charge
# equally over the two carboxylate oxygens [for Asp/Glu/C-term], while leaving the group unprotonated in the calculations."
# "For basic groups... distributing the subtraction of a unit charge equally over the three hydrogens on each of these groups,
# while leaving the site fully protonated in the calculations."
# "The charges of all ionizable groups except histidine are localized to one or two atoms of the side chain,
# obtained by subtracting or adding one unit of charge from the neutral form of an acidic or basic residue"
# This implies that for the Q_i Q_j calculations involving ionizable groups, q_i and q_j are +1 or -1 (or fractional if pH-dependent).
# For Q_i q_j (charge-polar), q_j are the permanent partial charges.
